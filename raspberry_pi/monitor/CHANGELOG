*** Improvements
- Added ability to publish multiple sensor datasets to single device
- Converted logging to python standard logging facility
- Moved caching function to individual function
- Publish function now decides where records are sent - streamlines code reuse
- Debugging added to help find errors in configuration and connectivity

  gather weather data from multiple sources.
